I am writing to express my keen interest in being considered for the **Practical Devops Boot Camp**. As an intern in networking, I have cultivated foundational skills and gained practical experience in the field. Recently, I successfully passed the **CCNA exam**, which has deepened my understanding of networking concepts and enhanced my technical expertise.

However, as the tech landscape continues to evolve, I am eager to transition from networking to **cloud operations** to align my career with current industry trends. I am particularly interested in expanding my knowledge of **cloud platforms like Azure**, as well as diving deeper into **Kubernetes** and **container orchestration**. My **intermediate proficiency in Linux** serves as a solid foundation for this learning journey, and I am eager to build upon it during the boot camp.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to join this program as a beginner in cloud operations, with a commitment to gaining hands-on experience and a robust understanding of the tools and technologies driving the future of tech. I believe this boot camp will provide the structured learning environment I need to achieve these goals.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to and growing within the program. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how this opportunity aligns with my aspirations.
